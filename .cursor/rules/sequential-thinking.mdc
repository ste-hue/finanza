# Sequential Thinking Usage Patterns

## When to Use Sequential Thinking MCP
- Complex features with 3+ distinct steps
- Business logic changes affecting multiple components
- Database schema modifications
- Financial calculation logic changes
- Multi-step data import/export processes

## How to Use Effectively
1. Start with problem decomposition
2. Build reasoning chains step-by-step  
3. Let AI create its own context and prompts
4. Use for planning before coding, not during coding

## Example Trigger Scenarios
- "Implement consolidation workflow for past months"
- "Add new category type with proper relationships"
- "Design Excel import with validation and error handling"
- "Modify month status logic to handle edge cases"

## Pattern
```
Sequential Thinking → Plan → MCP Database Exploration → Code Implementation
```

Think of it as your planning REPL - the AI builds its own reasoning chain to solve complex problems methodically.
